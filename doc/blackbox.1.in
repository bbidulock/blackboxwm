.SH DESCRIPTION

.\" ----- overview -----
Blackbox is a window manager for the Open Group's
X Window System, Version 11 Release 6 and above.
Its design is meant to be visually minimalist and fast.
.PP
.\" ----- usage overview -----
Blackbox is similar to the NeXT interface and
Windowmaker. Applications are launched using a
menu which is accessed by right clicking on the
root window. Workspaces, a system of virtual 
desktops are controlled via a menu which is accessed 
by middle clicking on the root window and by using 
the toolbar. Individual windows can be controlled by 
buttons on the title bar and more options are available 
by right clicking on the title bar.
.PP
.\" ----- design overview -----
Blackbox is able to generate beautiful window
decorations on the fly at high speed. Themes,
called styles in Blackbox terminology, are very
flexible but the use of pixmaps has been 
purposefully avoided to eliminate dependencies 
and excess memory usage.
.PP
.\" ----- bbtools overview -----
Blackbox itself does not directly handle key
bindings like most other window managers. This
task is handled by a separate utility called
bbkeys. Although Blackbox has a built-in
workspace (paging) system, bbpager, which provides
a graphical pager, is popular with many users.
bbkeys, bbpager and several other bbtools can be found
by going to

.B http://bbtools.thelinuxcommunity.org/
.EE
.\" ----- slit overview -----
The slit is an edge of the screen which can
hold specially designed programs called dock
apps (from Windowmaker). In addition, the 
popular program gkrellm will also run in the slit. 
There is a huge selection of dockapps available 
and they run the gamut from must-have gadgets 
to utterly useless (but cute and/or funny) eye candy.

environment variable to this value for programs 
started by Blackbox.
.PP
.\"
.\" * * * * * STARTING AND EXITING BLACKBOX * * * * *
.\"
.SH STARTING AND EXITING BLACKBOX
The most common method for starting Blackbox 
is to place the the command "blackbox" (no quotes)
at the end of your 
.B ~/.xinitrc
or
.B ~/.xsession
file. 
The advantage of putting Blackbox at the end of the file
is that the X Server will shutdown when you exit 
Blackbox. Blackbox can also be started from 
the command line of a terminal program like xterm in an
X session that does not already have a window manager running.
.PP
On startup, Blackbox will look for 
.B ~/.blackboxrc 
and use the resource 
.B session.menuFile 
to determine where to get the menu for the session. 
If this file is not found Blackbox will use
.B @defaultmenu@
as the menu file. If that fails as well Blackbox 
will use a default menu that contains commands 
to start an xterm as well as restart and exit the window manager.
The other resources available in the 
.B ~/.blackboxrc 
file are discussed later in this manual under 
the heading RESOURCE FILE.

On exit, Blackbox writes its current configuration to 
.B ~/.blackboxrc. 
.EX 0
.B NOTE: 
If ~/.blackboxrc is modified during a Blackbox 
session, Blackbox must be restarted with the 
"restart" command on the main menu or the changes 
will be lost on exit. Restart causes Blackbox to 
re-read ~/.blackboxrc and apply the changes immediately.
.EE
Blackbox can be exited by selecting "exit" on
the main menu (discussed shortly), killing it
gently from a terminal or by the X Window System 
shutdown hot key combo Ctrl+Alt+BackSpace.

.SH USING BLACKBOX
.PP
A three button mouse has the following functions 
when clicking on the root window:
.TP
.BR "Button Two" "  (Middle Button)"
Open workspace menu
.TP
.BR "Button Three" "  (Right Button)"
Open main menu
.TP
Note that Button One (Left Button) is not used.
.\"
.\" ***** MAIN MENU ******
.\"
.TP
.B Main Menu
The default installation assumes you have a number 
of common X Window System programs in their typical
locations. The default menu is defined by a plain text
file named 'menu'. It is heavily commented and covers a
number of details of menu file syntax. This file can also
be edited graphically by using the extension program bbconf
which makes menu creation very easy. Menu file syntax is
discussed later in this manual.
.EX 0
.\" ----- main menu caveat -----
.B Caveat:
Menus can run arbitrary command lines, but
if you wish to use a complex command line 
it is best to place it in a shell script. 
Remember to put #!/bin/sh on the first 
line and chmod 755 on the file to make it 
executable.
.EE
.\"
.\" ***** WORKSPACE MENU *****
.\"
.TP
.B Workspace Menu
This menu gives the user control of the workspace 
system. The user can create a new workspace,
remove the last workspace or go to an application
via either the icon menu or a workspace entry.
Workspaces are listed by name. Clicking on the 
workspace name will take you to that workspace
with focus on the program under the mouse. If 
there are programs already running in the 
workspace, they will appear in a pop-out menu. 
Clicking on the application name will jump to 
the workspace and focus that application. If a
middle click is used the window will be brought to
the current workspace.

Blackbox uses an external program, bbpager,
to provide a traditional, graphical paging
interface to the workspace system. Many Blackbox
users run another extension program - bbkeys -
to provide keyboard shortcuts for workspace control.
.EX 0
.\" ----- workspace caveat -----
.B Caveat: 
To name a workspace the user must right
click on the toolbar, select "Edit current 
workspace name," type the workspace name, 
And_Press_Enter to finish.
.EE
Workspaces can also be named in the .blackboxrc
file as described in RESOURCES.
.\"
.\" ***** THE SLIT *****
.\"
.TP
.B The Slit
The Slit provides a user positionable window for 
running utility programs called "dockapps". To 
learn more about dockapps refer to the web sites
mentioned in the Description. Dockapps 
automatically run in the slit in most cases, but
may require a special command switch.  
Often, -w is used for "withdrawn" into the slit.

gkrellm is a very useful and modern dockapp that
gives the user near real time information on 
machine performance. Other dockapps include clocks,
notepads, pagers, key grabbers, fishbowls, fire
places and many, many others. 

Only mouse button three is captured by the 
Blackbox slit. This menu allows the user to change 
the position of the slit, and sets the state of 
Always on top, and Auto hide. These all do what 
the user expects.

.EX 3
.\" ----- slit caveat -----
.B Caveat:
When starting Dockapps from an external script
a race condition can take place where the shell
rapidly forks all of the dockapps, which then
take varied and random times to draw themselves 
for the first time. To get the dockapps to start 
in a given order, follow each dockapp with 
sleep 2; This ensures that each dockapp is placed 
in the correct order by the slit.
.EE
.EX 8
.B i.e.
#!/bin/sh
speyes -w & sleep 2
gkrellm -w & sleep 2
.EE 
.\"
.\" ***** THE TOOLBAR *****
.\"
.TP
.B The Toolbar
The toolbar provides an alternate method for 
cycling through multiple workspaces and 
applications. The left side of the toolbar is 
the workspace control, the center is the 
application control, and the right side is a
clock. The format of the clock can be controlled
as described under RESOURCES.

Mouse button 3 raises a menu that allows 
configuration of the toolbar. It can be 
positioned either at the top or the bottom 
of the screen and can be set to auto hide 
and/or to always be on top.

.EX 
.\" ----- toolbar caveat -----
.B Caveat: 
The toolbar is a permanent fixture. It 
can only be removed by modifying the source and 
rebuilding, which is beyond the scope of this 
document. Setting the toolbar to auto hide is
the next best thing.
.EE

.\"
.\" ***** WINDOW DECORATIONS *****
.\"
.\" ----- overview -----
.TP 
.B Window Decorations
Window decorations include handles at the bottom of
each window, a title bar, and three control buttons.
The handles at the bottom of the window are divided 
into three sections.  The two corner sections are 
resizing handles The center section is a window 
moving handle. The bottom center handle and the 
title bar respond to a number of mouse clicks and 
key + mouse click combinations. The three buttons
in the title bar, left to right, are iconify, maximize,
and close. The resize button has special behavior 
detailed below.
.\"
.\" ----- mouse buttons -----
.\"
.TP
.BR "Button One" "  (Left Button)" 
Click and drag on titlebar to move or resize from bottom corners.
Click the iconify button to move the window to the icon list.
Click the maximize button to fully maximize the window.
Click the close button to close the window and application.
Double-Click the title bar to shade the window.
.TP
.BR "Alt + Button One" ""
Click anywhere on client window and drag to move the window.
.TP
.BR "Button Two" "  (Middle Button)"
Click the titlebar to lower the window.
Click the maximize button to maximize the window vertically.
.TP
.BR "Button Three" "  (Right Button)"

.TP
.B Maximize
Toggle window maximization.
.TP
.B Raise
Bring window to the front above the other windows and
focus it.
.TP
.B Lower
Drop the window below the other ones.
.TP
.B Stick
Stick this window to the glass on the inside of
the monitor so it does not hide when you change 
workspaces.
.TP

This kills the client program with -SIGKILL (-9)
Only use this as a last resort.
.TP
.B Close
Send a close signal to the client application.
.\"
.\" * * * * * STYLES * * * * * 
.\"
.\" ----- overview -----
.SH STYLES
Styles are a collection of colors, fonts,
and textures that control the appearance of
Blackbox. These characteristics are recorded
in style files. The default system style files
are located in
.I @pkgdatadir@/styles.
The menu system will identify the style by 
its filename, and styles can be sorted into
different directories at the user's discretion.

.\" ----- third party styles -----
There are over 700 styles available for 
Blackbox. The official distribution point for 
Blackbox styles is

.EX
.B http://blackbox.themes.org/
.EE

.\"
.\" ----- installing styles -----
.\"
All themes should install by simply downloading them 
to 
.B ~/.blackbox/
then unzip it, and de-tar it.

On open Unixes this will be:

.B tar zxvf stylename.tar.gz

On commercial Unixes this will be something like:

.B gunzip stylename.tar.gz && tar xvf stylename.tar

Check your system manuals for specifics or check with
your network administrator.

An entry should appear in the styles menu immediately.
.EX
.B Security Warning
Style files can execute shell scripts and other
executables. It would is wise to check the 
rootCommand in the style file and make sure that 
it is benign.
.EE
.TP
.B Things that go wrong.
.TP
1. The theme is pre Blackbox 0.51.
Style file syntax changed with version 0.51
.TP
2. The style tarball was formatted incorrectly.
Some styles use the directories 
.B ~/.blackbox/Backgrounds 
and
.B ~/.blackbox/Styles

This can fixed by adding a 
.B [stylemenu] (~/.blackbox/Styles)
to your menu file. To be a complete purist, hack 
the style file with the correct paths and move
the files into the correct directories
.TP
3. The rootCommmand line is broken.
The rootCommand line in the style file will run an 
arbitrary executable. It is important that this
executable be set to bsetbg to maintain portability 
between systems with different graphics software. In
addition bsetbg can execute a shell script and do it
in a portable fashion as well. 
.\"
.\" ----- style format ------
.\"
.TP
.B The documented method for creating styles is as follows:
.\" ----- background image -----
.TP
1. Create or acquire the background for the style if
it will not be using 
.B bsetroot 
to draw a patterned background for the root window. 

.EX
.B NOTE:
Blackbox runs on a wide variety 
of systems ranging from PCs with 640x480 256 color 
displays to ultra high speed workstations with 25" 
screens and extreme resolution. For best results a 
style graphic should be at least 1024x768.
.EE 
.\" ----- style file ------
.TP
2. Create a style file. 
The best way to do this is to make a copy of a 
similar style and then edit it. 

The style file is a list of X resources and other
external variables. Manipulating these variables 
allows users to completely change the appearance 
of Blackbox. The user can also change the root 
window image by using the wrapper program 
.B bsetbg.

bsetbg knows how to use a number of programs to
set the root window image. This makes styles much
more portable since various platforms have different 
graphics software. For more info see 
.B bsetbg (1).
.\" ----- directory layout
.TP
3. Background images should be placed in
.B ~/.blackbox/backgrounds
The style file should be placed in
.B ~/.blackbox/styles
any other information about the style should 
be placed in 
.B ~/.blackbox/about/STYLE_NAME/.
This would include README files, licenses, etc.

Previous versions of Blackbox put backgrounds 
and styles in different directories. The 
directories listed above are the only officially 
supported directories.  However you may put them
whereever you like as long as you update your menu
file so it knows where to find your styles.
.\" ----- tarball -----
.TP
4. To create a consistent experience and to ensure
portability between all systems it is important 
to use the following format to create your style
archive.

first create a new directory named 
after your style
.B NEW_STYLE

In this directory create the 
directories
.EX
.B backgrounds
.B styles
.B about/NEW_STYLE
.EE
Next put everything for the theme 
in these locations. Finally type

tar cvzf NEW_STYLE.tar.gz *

If you are using commercial Unix you may 
need to use gzip and tar separately.

Now when a user downloads a new style file
she knows that all she has to do is put
the tarball in her Blackbox directory,
unzip->un-tar it and then click on it in her
style menu.
.TP
.B
.\" ----- X resources -----
.SH Style File Syntax and Details

By far the easiest way to create a new style is to 
use bbconf. bbconf allows complete control of every 
facet of style files and gives immediate updates of
the current style as changes are made.

The style file format is not currently documented in
a man page.  There is a readme document included with
the Blackbox source containing this information.
.\"
.\" * * * * * MENU FILE * * * * *
.\"
.\" ----- overview -----
.SH MENU FILE
The default menu file is installed in 
.B @defaultmenu@.
This menu can be customized as a system 
default menu or the user can create a 
personal menu.

To create a personal menu copy the 
default menu to a file in your home directory.
Then, open 
.B ~/.blackboxrc 
and add or modify the resource
.BI "session.menuFile:" "  ~/.blackbox/menu"

Next, edit the new menu file. This can be done 
during a Blackbox session and the menu will 
automatically be updated when the code checks
for file changes.

The default menu included with Blackbox has 
numerous comments describing the use of all 
menu commands. Menu commands follow this general 
form:

.BI "[command]" "  (label|filename) {shell command|filename}" 
.\"
.\" ----- menu commands -----
.\"
.TP
.B Blackbox menu commands:
.TP
.BI "   #    " "string..."
Hash (or pound or number sign) is used as the comment delimiter. It can
be used as a full line comment or as an end of 
line comment after a valid command statement.
.TP
.BI "[begin]" "  (string)"
This tag is used only once at the beginning of the 
menu file. "string" is the name or description used
at the top of the menu.
.TP
.BI "[end]       " "" 
This tag is used at the end of the menu file
and at the end of a submenu block.
.TP
.BI "[exec]" "  (label string) {command string}"
This is a very flexible tag that allows the user
to run an arbitrary shell command including shell
scripts. If a command is too large to type on the 
command line by hand it is best to put it in a 
shell script. 
.TP
.BI "[nop]" "  (label string)"
This tag is used to put a divider in the menu.
.I label string
is an optional description.
.TP
.BI "[submenu]" "  (submenu name) {title string}"
This creates a sub-menu with the name
.I submenu name
and if given, the string
.I title string
will be the title of the pop up menu itself.
.TP
.BI "[include]" "  (filename)"
This command inserts
.I filename
into the menu file at the point at which it is
called. 
.I filename
should not contain a begin end pair. This feature
can be used to include the system menu or include a
piece of menu that is updated by a separate program.
.TP
.BI "[stylesdir]" "  (description) (path)"
Causes Blackbox to search 
.I path
for style files. Blackbox lists styles in the menu
by their file name as returned by the OS.
.TP
.BI "[stylesmenu]" "  (description) {path}"
This command creates a submenu with the name
.B description
with the contents of 
.B path.
By creating a submenu and then populating it 
with stylesmenu entries the user can create an
organized library of styles.
.TP
.BI "[workspaces]" "  (description)"
Inserts a link into the main menu to the workspace
menu. If used,
.I description
is an optional description.
.TP
.BI "[config]" "  (label)"
This command causes Blackbox to insert a menu that
gives the user control over focus models, dithering
and other system preferences.
.TP
.BI "[reconfig]" "  (label) {shell command}"
The reconfig command causes Blackbox to reread its 
configuration files. This does not include 
.B ~/.blackboxrc
which is only reread when Blackbox is restarted. If
.I shell command
is included Blackbox will run this command or 
shell script before rereading the files. This can 
be used to switch between multiple configurations
.TP
.BI "[restart]" "  (label) {shell command}"
This command is actually an exit command that
defaults to restarting Blackbox. If provided
.B shell command
is run instead of Blackbox. This can be used
to change versions of Blackbox. Not that you would
ever want to do this but, it could also be used
to start a different window manager. 
.TP
.BI "[exit]" "  (label)"
Shuts down Blackbox. If Blackbox is the last command in your
.B ~/.xinitrc
file, this action will also shutdown X. 
.EX 
.B Here is a working example of a menu file:
.\" ----- menu example -----
[begin] (MenuName)
   [exec] (xterm) {xterm -ls -bg black -fg green}
   [submenu] (X utilities)
      [exec] (xcalc) {xcalc}
   [end]
   [submenu] (styles)
      [stylesmenu] (built-in styles) {@pkgdatadir@/styles}

These options are stored in the ~/.blackboxrc file.
They control various features of Blackbox and most
can be set from menus. Some of these can
only be set by editing .blackboxrc directly.

NOTE: Blackbox only reads this file during start
up. To make changes take effect during a Blackbox
session the user must choose "restart" on the main menu.
If you do not do so, your changes will be lost when
Blackbox exits.

.BI "session.screen<num>.disableBindingsWithScrollLock" "  [True|False]"
When this resource is enabled, turning on scroll lock
keeps Blackbox from grabbing the Alt and Ctrl keys
that it normally uses for mouse controls. This feature
allows users of drawing and modeling programs which use
keystrokes to modify mouse actions to maintain their sanity.
*NOTE* this has _no_ affect on bbkeys.  If you need bbkeys to also
behave this way it has a similar option in its config file.  Refer
to the bbkeys manpage for details.

.BI "session.screen<num>.edgeSnapThreshold" "  [integer]"
When set to 0 this turns off edge snap. When set to one
or greater edge snap will cause a window that is being
moved to snap to the nearest screen edge, the slit, or
or the toolbar. Windows will not snap to each other.
The value represents a number in pixels which is the distance
between the window and a screen edge which is required before
the window is snapped to the screen edge.  If you prefer this
functionality values between 6 - 10 work nicely.

.BI "session.doubleClickInterval" "  [integer]"
This is the maximum time that Blackbox will wait after
one click to catch a double click. This only applies to
Blackbox actions, such as double click shading, not to the X
server in general.
.EX

is the current maintainer and is actively working 
together with Brad to keep Blackbox up-to-date and 
stable as a rock.

.BI "Brad Hughes" "  <bhughes@trolltech.com>"
originally designed and coded Blackbox in 1997 with 
the intent of creating a memory efficient window 
manager with no dependencies on external libraries. 
Brad's original idea has become a popular alternative 
to other window managers.

.BI "Jeff Raven" "  <jraven@psu.edu>"
then picked up the torch for the 0.61.x series after 
Brad took a full time job at TrollTech.
