NEWS for version 0.2.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

new features:
=============

o  Change the cmp_CallChains_by_*_for_Qsort functions to not return 0 so
   often by comparing them on address data, too. (This means we have to
   read in the data from gdb before sorting the callchains.) This allows
   one to compare resulting log files from different runs of the same
   program with, e.g. diff or emacs ediff, without getting too many
   irrelevant differences (Johannes).

o  Last, but not least, read address data for dynamic libraries from gdb
   as well. Only works for those dynamic libraries that the program is
   linked with, not the ones that are dlopen'ed explicitly. Controlled
   by a flag called `load-dynlibs' (Johannes).

o  new flag `align-8-byte' to align memory to 8 byte on Linux.

bugfixes:
=========

o  The configure script now tries to find the standard C library (libc.so)
   and checks if it can be opened with dlopen.  This should make ccmalloc
   run on Redhat 5.0 Linux out of the box.

o  GPL ;-)

o  Fix the src/Makefile so that it also installs the config file and
   so that install depends on ccmalloc.o (Johannes).

NEWS for version 0.2.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

bug fixes:
==========

o  `wrapper.c' did not handle realloc correctly while in state INITIALIZING.

   This lead to `*** realloc(0x8065f3d) called with non valid argument'
   before the program was even started. This bug occured when using KDE
   together with Qt. Now even the static allocator in wrapper.c saves the
   size of the allocated data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS for version 0.2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

bug fixes:
==========

o  returned data is now 8 byte aligned on SunOS and Solaris. This avoids
   a Bus Error when allocating heap memory for doubles.
   (a lot of people reported that bug)

o  shrinking allocated data with realloc works now
   (a lot of people reported that bug)

o  fixed dereferencing bug in cmpAddr (Johannes Keukelaar)

o  calls fflush before killing itself

new features:
=============

o  `only-log-chain' and `dont-log-chain' (Johannes Keukelaar)

o  `logpid' (Didier Remy)
